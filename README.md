This part contains some reference papers about this project

## 2. Data

Data contains two folder (1) Original dataset (2) Smaller dataset

(1) Original dataset: The data is provided by the paper

(2) Smaller dataset: Chose the original dataset randomly and 40% of original dataset are used as the smaller dataset.

The dataset can be obtained in: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fQ9_4Wfb9v0wMwYM8CVdIYnlMqrynvX5?usp=sharing

Attention: The original smaller dataset has been updated!
